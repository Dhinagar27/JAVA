what is programming language 
   
   pices of instruction that we are giving to the computer to perform a task

types of languages :
    
    procedural 
    functional 
    object oriented 

    other types :
        
        static languages :
           
            perform type checking in compile time
            error will show at compile time 
            declare datatype before you see it  
            more control

            example ( java )

        Dynamic language :

            perform type checking at runtime
            error might not show till program is runtime
            no need to declare datatype of variables 
            saves time in writing code but might give error at runtime

            example ( python )


memory management :
     
     there are two type of memory :
          
          stack 
          heap

      example :

        Here  a = 10
              
              a = is referance variable(stored in the stack)

              10 = is the object(stored in the heap)
          
              when we call "a" it will print(10) because it has the pointing  the value "10":

              note that  10 is not stored in a....

      referance and object :
          
          a = [1,2,3,4,5]

          b = a

            Here "a" and "b" pointing to the same object [1,2,3,4,5] 

            if there any changes in  "ONE referance variable" it will also affect the "other one"        

      object with no referance variable :

           if this happen it removed from memory when garbage collection hits

          like 
           
           a = 10  then 

           a = 37  here "a" is pointing to object "37" 

                   so 10 will become alone like (without a referance variable) so it will be removed
