How Java code Executes :


                         compiler                                  interpreter
   .java file       ------------------>      .class file       -------------------->     Machine code

  human readable      (entire file)            byte code            (line by line)           0 and 1

      |                                            |
                                                   |
      |
  source code


-------> byte code 
            
            this code will not directly run on a system
            we need JVM to run this 
            Reason why Java is platform independent



More about platform independence 

        it means that byte code can run on all operating systems

        we need to convert source code to machine code so computer can understand 

        comipler helps in doing this by turning it into executable code 

        this executetble code is a set of instruction for the computer
        
        after compling c / c++ code we get .exe file which is platform dependent 
        
        it jaava we get bytecode JVM converts this to machine code 

        java is platform independent but JVM is platform dependent




Architecture :  
     
     JDK 
        
        JRE 
           
            JVM
               
                JIT


JDK vs JRE vs JVM vs JIT 

 JDK - java development kit
      
      provids environment to develop and run the java program
      it is a packagae that includes:

           development tools 
           JRE            - execute your program
           A compiler     - javac
           archiver       - jar
           docs Generator - javadoc
           interpreter /loader

  JRE - java runtime environment 

      it is an installation package that provides environment to only run the program
      it consist of :
          
          deployment technologys 
          user interface toolkits 
          integration libraries 
          base libraries
          JVM
  
  JVM - java virtual machine
       
       loading 
       linking 
       installation

       JVM contains the stack and heap memory allocation

  JIT - Just in time




  source code ---------- > JDK (.javac file) ----------> Byte code -----------> JVM -----------> JRE
                
                      
JRE is the box and JVM is the content in the JRE box 
       
       JVM do all function with help JRE 
            
            JRE provide various libraries and so on
