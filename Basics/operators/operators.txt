Operator
   
   are symbols that perform the operation on operant

Exmaple 

    a = 10; a = operant  " = " = operator

Types of operator
   
   Unary operator - 1 operant

       +  (plus)
       -  (minus)
       ++ (increment)
          post increment ( a++ )
          pre  increment ( ++a)
       -- (decrement)
          post decrement ( a-- )
          pre  decrement ( --a )

   Binary operator - 2 operants

        Arithmetic operator
            
            + (Addition)
            - (Subtraction)
            * (Multiplication)
            / (Division)
            % (Remainder)
        
        Relational operator (Used to compare two numbers or two operants)
            
            == (Equal)
            != (Not Equal)
            <  (less than)
            >  ( Greater than)
            >= (Greater than or equal to)
            <= (less than or equal to)

        Assignment operator (used to assign in order of right to left)
          
            =  (Assignment) 
            += (Addition Assignment )
            -=  (Subtraction Assignment )
            *= (Multiplication Assignment)
            /= (Division Assignment)
            %= (modulus Assignment)

        logical operators (logically based on short circuit)

            if the statement is false or true it will not move to next statement
            
            && always hunt a false 
            || always hunt a true
            !  True = False and False = True
        
        Bitwise operators ( Bitwise are uesed to perform operation on binary bits)

             if the statement is false or true it will  move to next statement 
             1 - True And 0 - False
             
             & (Bitwise AND)
             | (Bitwise OR)
             ^ (Bitwise XOR)
             << (left Shift)   
             >> (right Shift)
             >>> (unsigned right Shift)
                         


   Ternary operator - 3 operants

        ?: (conditonal operator)
