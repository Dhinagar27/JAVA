Amstrong number

(A, B, C, â€¦, N) are the digits of the number.
(n) is the total count of digits.
For example, consider the number 153:

It has three digits (1, 5, 3).
We raise each digit to the power of 3 (since there are three digits), and then sum them up:
(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153)
Since the result equals the original number, we can confirm that 153 is indeed an Armstrong number.

370: (3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370)
371: (3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 371)
407: (4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3 = 407)
1634: (1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1634)
8208: (8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4 = 8208)
9474: (9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 9474)
Some interesting facts about Armstrong numbers:

All single-digit numbers are Armstrong numbers because raising a single digit to the power of 1 yields the original number itself.
There are no 2-digit Armstrong numbers.
There are four 3-digit Armstrong numbers and three 4-digit Armstrong numbers.
As the number of digits increases, the count of Armstrong numbers decreases
