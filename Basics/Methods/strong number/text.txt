Strong number


A strong number is a positive integer whose sum of the factorials of its digits equals the original number itself. 
In other words, if we take the digits of a number, calculate the factorial of each digit, and sum those factorials, 
the result should be the same as the original number. Here are a few examples of strong numbers:

145: The sum of the factorials of its digits is (1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145), which matches the original number.
Since (2! = 2), it is also a strong number.
40585: The sum of the factorials of its digits is (4! + 0! + 5! + 8! + 5! = 24 + 1 + 120 + 40320 + 120 = 40585).
